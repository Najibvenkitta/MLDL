are we completed the preprocessing?

removal of columns with most of the values are null
missing vlaue handling
outlier removal
removal of columns with no correlation
dummy varible creation

-0.2 < corr < 0.2  the relationship is very weak. it is okay to avoid such columns.
Categorical variable - you can check for the distribution-- if its uniformly distributed,
that column can be avoided.



after creating dummy variables, the preprocessing steps are done.

we need to make the data ready for ML training..


	Input variables		output variables/Target Variable
	IV			DV			
	X			y

we need to split the dataframe (data) into X and y

y - SalesPrice
X - input featrues (data - salesprice)



Right Now we have 2 dataframe, X and y

And now we need to again split X and y for training and testing.


We have X and y


These X and y should be splitted for training and testing - say 2/3rd of the data can be used for training and 1/3 for testing.

we have 1460 rows, say 900 rows will be used for training and remaining will be used for testing
So the data for training shoud be randomnly selected. This will minimize if any bias present.


Xtrain,ytrain - train_test_split function is used to split the data randomnly.
Xtest,ytest

What are steps in ML modelling?
1.Idenify the algorithm
2.Train (fit) the algorithm using training data
3 Evaluate(test) the agorithm using testing data
4.Calculate the evaluation matrix


S1- Since saleprice is coninuous in nature - Regression algorithms should be used, and hence we choose LinearRegression
S2- Training of LR model using the training data - Xtrain,ytrain
S3- Trained model is evaluated using testing data - Xtest,ytest
S4- Calculate the evalution matrix - MSE,R^2 values for a regression model.

We have a Python API(package) Sklearn for ML functionalities.


y= m1x1+m2x2+......+m277x277+c
