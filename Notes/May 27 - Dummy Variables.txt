Dummy Variables - Label Encoding+onehot encoding
Linear Regression equation looks like
y=mx+c

x - independet/input variable
we are representing this equation in x-y plane.

assume a column with values male and female.
How will you represent male and female values in x-y plane?

Gender	labelEncode	OneHotEncoding (True or False in every coulmn) - 
			Gender_Male	Gender_Female	Gender_Other	

Male	1		1		0		0			
Female	0		0		1		0
Male	1		1		0		0	
Female	0		0		1		0
Other	2		0		0		1
Female	0		0		1		0
Other	2		0		0		1

We will arrange these catagories in assending order and label numerical values, like 0,1,2...
Usually I remove the first coulmn from onehot encoding and the master column

get_dummies function is used to create OneHot Encoding to convert categorical features into corresponding numerical featreus.
