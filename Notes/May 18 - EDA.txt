Machine Learning Work Flow
s1 - Problem and Data Idntification
s2 - EDA and preprocessing
s3 - Model selection and training
s4 - Productionize/ hosting of the solution

75% of the time is spend for EDA and preprocessing.

EDA -Exploratory Data Analysis
This is one of the most important steps in Data Analytics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

maximize insight into a data set;
uncover underlying structure;
extract important variables;
detect outliers and anomalies;

for EDA we will be using Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn

General outline for EDA
1.Preview data - head(),tail(),describe(),info()
2.Check total number of entries and column types -shape,dtypes
3.Check any null values -isna() - identify the methods to remove/replace null values
4.Check duplicate entries - duplicated(),drop_duplicate()
5.Check outlier values - identify the methods to remove/replace outlier values
6.Plot distribution of numeric data (univariate and pairwise joint distribution) - different graphs
7.Plot count distribution of categorical data -histogram/boxplot
8.Analyse time series of numeric data by daily, monthly and yearly frequencies - this is for timeseries data.

Univariate analysis
-histogram
-boxplot
Boxplots are a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”).

Boxplot is used to identify the outlier values.
