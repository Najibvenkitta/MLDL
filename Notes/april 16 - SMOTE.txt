if the data is biased we have to implement some balancing mechanisms.
SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 


true - 1000
false - 150 + 850 synthetic data will be created. this has to be only used for training- 
only the real data should be used for testing


there is a high bias from class true- to avoid this SMOTE has to be implemented.

SMOTE is only for binary classification.

Cancer detection - positive wil be very less - 1-5%
fraud transaction -  1-5%

we need balancing

inbalanced means not-50:50, min 20% is required for 1 class..


				actual
		
			X	Y	Z
predicted 	X	10	2	2
		
		Y	1	12	2

		Z	3	1	10


True Classification - 10+12+10  = 32 
False Classification - 2+2+1+2+3+1 = 11

Acuracy = 32/32+11 = 32/43
