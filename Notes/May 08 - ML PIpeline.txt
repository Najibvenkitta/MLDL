ML Pipeline
It surely helps to enforce desired order of application steps which in turn helps in reproducibility and creating a convenient work-flow.

creating a workflow by arranging steps in sequential order.


StandardScaler

StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation. 

StandardScaler results in a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. The variance is equal to 1 also, because variance = standard deviation squared. 
And 1 squared = 1.
StandardScaler makes the mean of the distribution 0. About 68% of the values will lie be between -1 and 1.

Xnew = (X-Xmean)/SD


MinMaxScaler 
MinMaxScaler  normalize a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit range.Unit range means dividing all the values by the Range(Max-Min).
Xnew=(X-Xmean)/(Xmax-Xmin)

if there is only postive elements
Max =1
Min =0
