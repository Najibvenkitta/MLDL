Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. 
Said another way — all deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms, but many machine learning algorithms do not use deep learning.

Deep learning refers specifically to a class of algorithm called a neural network, 
and technically only to “deep” neural networks (more on that in a second). 
This first neural network was invented in 1949, but back then they weren’t very useful. 
In fact, from the 1970’s to the 2010’s traditional forms of AI would consistently outperform neural network based models.


A deep neural network consists of a hierarchy of layers, whereby each layer
transforms the input data into more abstract representations (e.g. edge ->
nose -> face). The output layer combines those features to make predictions.

Learns by generating an error signal that measures the difference between the
predictions of the network and the desired values and then using this error signal
to change the weights (or parameters) so that predictions get more accurate.


X1	X2	b1	y
1	0	1	1


H1 - sigmoid(b1w0+X1w1+X2w3) = sigmoid(0.5+.1+0) = sigmoid(0.6)
H2 - sigmoid(b1w0+X1w2+X2w4) = sigmoid(0.5+.2+0) = sigmoid(0.7)

O1 -sigmoid(b2w0+H1w5+H2w6)
O1 -sigmoid(b2w0+H1w7+H2w8) 

w0 = 0.5
w1 = 0.1
w2 = 0.2
w3 = 0.3
w4 = 0.4
w5 = 0.5
w6 = 0.6
w7 = 0.7
w8 = 0.8
