Time Series Analysis

Time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals.

Depending on the frequency of observations, a time series may typically be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual. 
Sometimes, you might have seconds and minute-wise time series as well, like, number of clicks and user visits every minute etc.

Time series analysis involves understanding various aspects about the inherent nature of the series so that you are better informed 
to create meaningful and accurate forecasts.


What is panel data?

The difference is that, in addition to time series, it also contains one or more related variables that are measured for the same time periods.
Typically, the columns present in panel data contain explanatory variables that can be helpful in predicting the Y, 
provided those columns will be available at the future forecasting period.

Any time series may be split into the following components: Base Level + Trend + Seasonality + Residue

A trend is observed when there is an increasing or decreasing slope observed in the time series. 
Whereas seasonality is observed when there is a distinct repeated pattern observed between regular intervals due to seasonal factors. 
It could be because of the month of the year, the day of the month, weekdays or even time of the day.

So, a time series may be imagined as a combination of the trend, seasonality and the error terms.

Additive and multiplicative time series?

Depending on the nature of the trend and seasonality, a time series can be modeled as an additive or multiplicative, 
wherein, each observation in the series can be expressed as either a sum or a product of the components:

Additive time series:
Value = Base Level + Trend + Seasonality + Error

Multiplicative Time Series:
Value = Base Level x Trend x Seasonality x Error
