What is Machine Learning?
	- Allow the machines to learn from examples and experience
`	- ## Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model

Apllication of Machine Learning?
	- Google Assistant
	- Robotics and chatbots
	- Self driving cars
	- targeted marketing
	- Spam Emails
	- Face Recognition (smartphones, laptops, facebook, google photos)
	- Recommadation systems (Gmail, Amazon, Facebook,Youtube,Netflix,Spotify)
	- Medical diagnosis(diagnosis from xrays, scans etc)
	- Weather forecasting
	- Match forecasting

What is the common nature of the above usecases?
	- Assisting/easening the tasks
	- Pattern matching
	- Predicting an unknown
	- ## no predefined equations 
	- ## Learning from historic data


E : Experience(Data)
T : Task
P : Performance
As Experience(E) incerases(data increases) the Performance(P) of the algorithm becomes better for same Task(T)


for ML Programming
	- Python (version 3.x)
	- Pandas(PanalData) - used for data transformation and preprocessing
	- Numpy(NumericalPython) - used for vector/matrix/mathematical operations
	- Matplotlib/Seaborn - used for visualization
	- Sci-kit Learn - Used for Machine Learning Algorithms,data preparation
	- NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) - Used for NLP	
	- Notebook - Used for programming

PIP can be used to install the above mentioned packages.

You can use Jupyter Notebook or Collab
