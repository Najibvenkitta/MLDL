Linear Regresison


This is an example for regression algorithm 
	mean our output wil be continous.

Input variables	Output variable
Independenant	Dependant

The DV Y is continuous in nature..
Examples for such Y - 

	Salary
	Height
	Distane
	Price
	Time taken
	Speed

can u determine the salary of a person from his/her YoE,Age,Domain,Education? - this can be a machine lerning problem, supervised learning, regression

You have all the placement history of luminar.
So can you assume what salary you wil get once you got placed?

we will be using the enitre data for training-- this will help us to know the all possible combinations.


###Time Series Analysis - Statistical model used for time oriented data

Linear Regression - Regression algorithm, the relationship btw X and Y wil be aways linear.


What do you mean by linear relationship?

	Change in Y wrto change in X will be linear in nature


Do you remember the equation of a line?

	Y= mX+C

Y = mX+c

Y is DV
X is IV

c- Y intercept of X
m- slope of the line



Age	Act.Salary ideal line	Red	actsal-Red	Yellow	actsal-Yellow	Green	actsal-green
10	10000		10000	9000	1000		12000	-2000		10000	0
15	16000		16000	15000	1000		16000	0		17500	-1500 (negative error)
20	22000		22000	21000	1000		25000	-3000		20500	1500 (positive error)
25	25000		25000	24500	500		22000	3000		27000	-2000
30	32000		32000	30000	2000		36000	-4000		31000	1000

NB:Dividing each value with 100 for easy calculation

Total Error			55			-60			-10

Total Squared Error		725			3800			950  min error is 725- Red.

Total Mean Squared Error(MSE)	145			760			190 (total squared error/no of observations)
 
Here the min error is -1000. and is this corret??
not sure.
a problem with this calculaton is, negative error and postive error got nullified.


we are taking the square of errors.

Red is the line with Minimum Squared Error. and hence considered as the best line for the data points.

Next Step :
Calculate M and C of only line Red.

Later Step:
Predicting the value of Y for X using M and C - Ouptut of Linear Regression.


Sklearn - is the pakcage for ML
LinearRegression Model - this model will identify the line with minimum error.


Simple Linear Regression and Multi Linear Regression

SLR- there is only one X and Y
	Y=mX+C

MLR - there will be multiple X and single Y
	Y=m1X1+m2X2+......+mnXn+C
