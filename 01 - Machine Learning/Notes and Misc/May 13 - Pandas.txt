Pandas - PanalData
This python package is used for data wrangling, data transformation and data preprocessing.

install pandas
	pip install pandas (Latest Stable Version)

import pandas
	import pandas as pd (here pd is the alias for pandas, later onwards pd can be used instead of pandas)


Different datatypes in pandas
	-Series - 1D data
	-DataFrame - 2D data - this is the most common datatype
	-Panel - 3D data

it comes with index.
Few fucntions from pandas
head(n) - display first n rows
tail(n) - display last n rows
describe() - summary of the dataframe

Stat functions
min()
max()
mean()
median()
mode()
std()

Parameters - for calling parameters () is not required
dtypes - will show the datatype of each column
	float64 - float values
	int64 - int values
	object - catagorical and string values
shape - will show the #rows and #columns

All these functions/parameters are essential to understand the data.


There can be many flaws within the data.
1.Pressence of missing data
2.Pressence of outlier values

What is missing data - in some of the obsevations a few features are not available.
how to identify the pressence of missing data?

isna()  - checking for missing value
isnull() - checking for null value
isnan() - checking for not a number data

Usually missing value cause an abscence of information in the cell.
But in some datasets, missing values can be filled with some random data(?,*,#) - this information should pass from the client side.

Missing Value handling 
	This is an important stage in preprocessing.
	There should be no missing data/null data in the dataset used for modelling
	1 - Removal of column
	2 - Removal of Row
`	3 - Replacing missing value with a suitable data

Option 1 and 2 can cause loss of data, so not advised
Best option in replacing the missing value with a suitable data.
	Replacement with Mean - for numerical data
	Replacement with Medain - for numerical data
	Replcement with Mode - for object data(categorical data)
