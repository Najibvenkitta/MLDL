Linear Regression
y=mx+c

LR model tries to identify the optimum values for m and c.
in other words, LR model tries to identify the best fit line.

There are infinite number of LR possible for a set of datapoints.
The best fit line is identified by Mean Squared Error(Least Squared Error)

Ideal Linear regression will have ZERO(0) MSE

Refer Excel for sample data

a problem with this calculaton is, negative error and postive error got nullified.

we are taking the square of errors.

Red is the line with Minimum Squared Error. and hence considered as the best line for the data points.

Next Step : 
Calculating value for m and c for Red line

Later Step :
Predict price(Y) using M and C for each input(X) - Ouptut of Linear Regression

Sklearn - is the pakcage for ML
LinearRegression Model - this model will identify the line with minimum error.


Simple Linear Regression and Multi Linear Regression

SLR- there is only one X and Y
	Y=mX+C

MLR - there will be multiple X and single Y
	Y=m1X1+m2X2+......+mnXn+C
