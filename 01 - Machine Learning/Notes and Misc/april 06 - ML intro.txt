diff between concat and merge???


concat - we consider only index...
there is not data level relationship identified....

concat - if column level ..#rows will remain same
	 if row level.. #cols will remain same

merge - we are considering a common field..

#rows and #cols will change...


ML Approach and steps
---------------------

Statstical Part
---------------
1.EDA is like first step
2.we wil be identifying the relevance of each fields
3.selecting or regecting fields-- we may delete some columns.. we may create some columns.
4.Preprocessing - Outlier removal, missing value handling, cat to numerical conversion

Core ML part
------------
5.identifying the ML model - mutiple algorithms and its implementation..
6.Model Training
7.Model evaluation

Deployement part
----------------
Deployement - not a ML engineer task.. its good to know.. we need Django or Flask.... ##optional.. good to have..


Sample Date for a model - equation is defined.. no need of ML
-----------------------
X  	Y     Y=X^2
5	25
10	100
12	144
15	225
6	36
8	64
9	?81 100% sure that tha value will be 81.. accuracy will be 10%
7	?49
13	?169





Condition for ML
----------------
1. There should'nt be any predefined equation for the solution. 
2. There should be enough historical data.
3. There should an algorithm

Can you list some real life ML usecases?

	1.FaceBook - Image tagging, friends suggestion
	2.Amazon Product Recommendation - (Recommendation system)
	3.Weather Forecasting
	4.Amazon Alexa and Google Home
	5.Youtube video Recommendation, Netflix, Spotify
	6.Face unlock in smartphone
	7.Game result prediciton - Football
	8.Grammarly and auto sentance completion in gmail - Natural Language Processing(NLP)
	9.Sentiment Analysis, Review Analysis(NLP)
	10.Number plate detection - Deep Learning Application
	11.Detection of illness from Xray - Cheast XRay - Deep learning application
	12.Mail spam detection


A sample ML Data - Can you find the relation between Y and X
------------------------------------------------------------

X1	X2	Y  	Supervised learning model will have both input and output in historical data
				X1 and X2 are the input, Y is the output
2	4	12		Here The ML algorithm will identify the relationship of X1 and X2 with Y 
3	5	23	
1	1	3		Y = F(X1,X2)
4	5	37		identifying the function (F) is part of ML algorithm..	
5	5	55
1	6	8	
6	1	73

Future Data
X1	X2	Y

10	10	? 210
5	8	? 58
0	0	? 0
0	4	? 4 
1	9	? 11

Y=2X1^2+X2

X1,X2 - Input variables
Y - Output/Target Variable

X1 and X2 are idenpendent variables - the values of x1 and x2 are not based on any other variable.
Y is a dependent variable - the value of y is based on (dependent of) x1 and x2.


Supervised Algorithms
---------------------
	1.Classification
	2.Regression

These grouping are based on the nature of the target variable..
	Classification - Target variable is discreet in nature
	Regression - Target variable is continuous in nature

	Most of the real world applications are classification.
	



Most commonly used algorithms:
------------------------------
For Classification
	1.Logistic Regression (3)
	2.Supoprt Vector Machine Classifier (5)
	3.Random Forest Classifier - Extension of Decision Tree (4)
	4.Neural Networks - this is part of deep learning (optional)
	5.KNN(K Nearest Neighbours) (6)
	6.Naive Bayes(7)

For Regression
	1.Linear Regression (1)
	2.Polynomial regression (2)
	3.Random Forest Regressor (4)

Regularization - Ridge(L2),Lasso Regression(L1) and Elastic Net
Hyper parmeter tuning.

Other algs
Unsupervised - K means clustering (7), PCA (optional)
Recommendation system - Collaborative Filtering (optional)
